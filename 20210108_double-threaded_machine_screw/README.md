## About

This machine screw is a standard M6x20 screw, but is threaded such that it will accept *both* clockwise and
anti-clockwise nuts. Besides being a curiosity, this design allows for two standard nuts to be used to lock in-place
along a length of screw, which is practical.

This screw was successfully 3D printed using Cura 4.8 to generate g-code for a standard Ender 3 printer. Default
settings were used.

The STL file was generated using `DICOMautomaton.` See

for a more thorough explanation and the necessary input file.
